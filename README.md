SLCA - Self Learned Cyber Agent

(A Agent (Intelligent) which will use deep learning (tesnorflow, ...) to use nmap, recon tools, and other tools for info gathering (and, much more of course but - I Start small and slowly)

as I will soon start my OSCP  Exam, I thought of doing this project.
This will not be used in the exam, or (even at all) in the course(or in any course) but I find it interesting.

Feel free to contact me for any questions or details!
